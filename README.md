Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
A citizen of the universe that loved technologies. 🔭 I’m currently working as an assistant researcher at High-Speed Networking Laboratory, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung Univerisity. I am familiar with Linux, Bahs Script, Python, C, and sometimes Java. 🌱 I’m currently learning how to optimize using Github to manage my work experiments. 

I managed a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHoBGgHadJzm-D_xVQCN1CA) channel to look forward to reaching and helping people by sharing something.
